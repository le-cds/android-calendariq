# Calendar IQ Connector

## Installation

The app is available [at the Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.hypotenubel.calendariq).

## For Developers

Feel free to open issues and submit pull requests.

If youâ€™re developing your own watchface and want to have this app send calendar information to your watchface as well, simply open an issue with the UUID of your watchface.
